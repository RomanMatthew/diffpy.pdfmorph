PDFmorph
========================================================================
# FIXME
PDFmorph is a Python software package designed to increase the insight
researchers can get into spectra collected for atomic pair distribution 
functions.

REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

PDFmorph requires Python 3 and several third party libraries 
that are used by PDFmorph and its components.

* NumPy              - library for scientific computing with Python
* matplotlib         - Python 2D plotting library
* SciPy              - library for highly technical Python computing
* diffpy.utils       - shared helper utilities for wx GUI, 
https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy.utils

# FIXME - add link for instructions
If you can't use conda and need to build from the sources, instructions are [here].

INSTALLATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The preferred method is to use Anaconda Python and install from the
"diffpy" channel of Anaconda packages ::

     conda config --add channels diffpy
     conda install diffpy.pdfmorph

# FIXME
PDFmorph can then be started from a terminal...
[insert more instructions here]

With Anaconda, PDFmorph can be later upgraded to the latest released
version using ::

     conda update diffpy.pdfmorph

With other Python distributions the program can be upgraded to
the latest version as follows ::

     easy_install --upgrade diffpy.pdfmorph


DEVELOPMENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

PDFmorph is an open-source software available in a git repository at
https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy.pdfmorph.

Feel free to fork the project and contribute! To install PDFmorph
in a development mode where the source files are used directly
rather than copied to a system directory, use ::

     python setup.py develop --user
